//! The window manager's half of the AI services bus.
//!
//! The aichat child (the pane) is one client; every other client's AI
//! service reaches it through here. The WM parses only the envelope and
//! the routing fields, never the tools:
//!
//! - an up-frame from client C is stamped `from = endpoint(C)` (the WM's
//!   own id for that client — never the sender's claim) and forwarded to
//!   the pane; the last `Register` from each client is remembered so the
//!   pane gets a REPLAY of every registration when it (re)connects;
//! - a down-frame from the pane names a target endpoint: it goes to that
//!   client's socket, or, for the WM's own `os` endpoint, is answered here;
//! - a client that dies produces a synthetic `Unregister` for the pane;
//! - the pane sliding in or out is broadcast as `ChatOpen` to every
//!   registered client, so an app's own embedded chat can step aside.
//!
//! The `os` service is the WM as an app: list, launch, focus, close, and
//! open — a file in its associated app, through the same typed
//! `OpenRequest` a file browser's double-click takes.
//!
//! Developer mode (`dev_mode.rs`, ADR 0004 §13) is consulted here, never
//! set. It overrides every approval of the apps it covers, so such an app is
//! announced to the pane with every tool approved in advance
//! ([`dev_approved`]: the pane confirms only `Destructive`, so those are sent
//! as `Act`, the Terminal's `run` included), and while it is on every call
//! the pane makes is audited, each approval it answered included
//! ([`audit_dev_call`]). When the mode changes the shell sends
//! [`AiBus::reannounce`] so the pane's view follows at once. The same two
//! functions serve the in-process leg (`pane_links.rs`).
