//! Agents' questions to the person (ADR 0004 §6): the shell's request
//! model for octos's `ask_user_question` on app peers, and where each
//! question is asked. A routing layer, not a view.
//!
//! | In | Here | Out |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | a broker's `user_question/requested` on an app peer's session or context ([`crate::host_tools::ShellToolHost`]) | [`Questions::requested`]: one [`Request`] with its owning app, peer, account, context, turn, the questions and options, who started the turn ([`Origin`]) and so which [`Conversation`] it belongs to | every [`Consumer`] hears it ([`subscribe`]) |
//! | the turn ended (the broker saw its terminal) | [`Questions::closed`] | the consumers hear it closed |
//! | the person answered on a shell surface | [`answer`], with a [`PersonAnswer`] | `user_question/respond` on the broker's link, once |
//! | nobody answered within the prompt deadline (10 min; `OCTOSENSE_PROMPT_DEADLINE_SECS`) | [`Questions::tick`] | declined (free text saying it expired, never an option), [`State::Expired`], kept visible |
//! | the person pressed Stop on the app's conversation | [`Questions::stop_agent`] | declined, the consumers hear it answered |
//!
//! **Which conversation: the turn's origin, not the session.** An app
//! agent's conversation has two lanes that run in parallel: the person's
//! (a sharing request context: the app's UI, its cards, the app) and the
//! system agent's (the peer session, `peer/input`); plain request contexts
//! are the app's too. A question from a turn the person or the
//! app started is the app's: [`Conversation::App`]. A question from a turn
//! the system agent started (`peer/input`) is the system agent's to relay,
//! so it goes to the system chat: [`Conversation::SystemChat`]. The
//! request keeps the turn's [`Origin`]: the one octos reports once it
//! carries `origin` on the event ([`Request::origin_reported`]), until then
//! the broker's derivation (the turns it started for `peer/input` are the
//! system agent's; a context's the person's; any other the app's). There
//! is no `host.ask`: octos keeps `ask_user_question` on host-driven turns
//! when the peer's `generic_tools` lists it.
//!
//! **Consumers.** The system chat subscribes and shows its questions in
//! its conversation (`crate::system_chat`). An app's are shown in its "Ask
//! <app>" panel (`crate::app_chat`) while that is open, and otherwise on
//! the shell's app-conversation surface (the approvals overlay's card,
//! `crate::approvals::view`): one surface at a time. Notification and
//! glance cards can subscribe the same way; none of them owns a question,
//! and none renders anything here.
//!
//! **Only the person answers, only through the shell.** The one answer
//! path is [`answer`], which needs a [`PersonAnswer`]: made only by the
//! shell's own surfaces from the person's tap or typing
//! ([`PersonAnswer::from_shell_surface`]; a test scans the sources). The
//! answer handle ([`QuestionAnswer`]) is the broker's, made for the host
//! connection the question came on; nothing an app reaches (its context,
//! a host service, an executor, the peer link, `host.request`) carries one
//! or can name a question: the broker refuses an app's attempt to answer
//! an id the host holds, and the peer link and the `octos` host service
//! have no method for it.
