//! A tile hosting an in-process module instance (aicontrol.md §3).
//!
//! Where `MpRunView` presents a child process's swapchain, this widget
//! draws an instance's ROOT — a widget minted inside the instance's own
//! splash isolate by `module_host.rs` — as a subtree of the desk, at the
//! rect the layout gives the tile. Pointer events reach the root as they
//! reach any widget (coordinates stay absolute: `Area` hit-testing is
//! `Cx`-absolute); keys reach it only while the window manager's focus is
//! on this tile, which is the gate a process tile gets from its swapchain
//! forwarding and a module tile has to make explicit. A press inside the
//! tile tells the WM to focus it, the way a press on a process tile does.
//!
//! The root is set by the host after `create` and cleared BEFORE the
//! instance's isolate is freed: the tile outlives the instance by its
//! close animation, and a widget whose heap is gone must not be drawn.
//!
//! The tile is also the fault line (ADR 0004 plan step 9). The root's
//! events and draw run under `module_host::contain`: a panic there is
//! caught HERE, not by the platform. The isolate and the script VM come
//! back on their own on the way up (`with_isolate`); a draw cuts the draw
//! context's stacks — turtles, clips, draw lists, passes, the overlay
//! scope, gauss captures — back to where the tile's own draw stood
//! (`Cx2d::unwind_mark` / `unwind_to`) and restores the modal bounds, so
//! the desk's frame still ends. The tile lets go of the root and the
//! keyboard at once; the shell then shows the app closed with a Restart
//! (`show_failed`) and frees the instance in the host's order.
