//! A published glance card on screen: a `Splash` isolate at the glance tile
//! size, running either an L0 card lowered the way App Hub's Card runner
//! lowers `page.card` (`octoscript_makepad::l0::prepare`, then
//! `design::to_makepad_ui`) or a `script` card as it was published.
//!
//! **Lowering.** A card bundle carries its kit in `kit/`; a glance card is
//! only a source and its data, so the host supplies the kit: the L0 kit
//! (palettes, derivations, `_kit.octoscript`) is compiled in from the pinned
//! Octoscript-Makepad checkout and assembled in memory in the Card runner's
//! order (base palette, the card's mood, derivations, kit, the lowered card).
//! Theme axes other than their identity values and native kit packs are not
//! offered on a tile: a card naming one is refused at publish, not drawn in
//! some other look.
//!
//! **Tile size.** Width: the glance column (the phone's screen minus 40 pt,
//! the desktop panel's 328 pt). Height: the card's own measured height,
//! clamped to [`TILE_MIN_HEIGHT`]..=[`TILE_MAX_HEIGHT`] (room for a whole
//! action card, its buttons included); until the first draw measures it,
//! [`TILE_DEFAULT_HEIGHT`]. A taller card is clipped at the cap ([`overflow`]
//! says by how much), or scrolled inside its tile where the surface offers
//! that ([`GlanceTiles::draw_scrolled`]: the glance panel); the app is one
//! tap away. A script card should size its root `Fit`.
//!
//! **Policy.** A tile's isolate runs under the publishing app's resolved
//! policy, applied exactly as the Card runner applies it
//! (`octosense_app_policy::splash_adapter::apply` with the app's
//! `isolate_settings`: its jail and quota, capabilities, hosts, prompt right,
//! budget and heap), so a card can do whatever the app's own UI can. A
//! native module (no manifest) publishes tiles with no capabilities and no
//! hosts, as does an app whose policy cannot be resolved (logged).
//!
//! **Input.** A tile is interactive: the surface hands it every event
//! ([`GlanceTiles::handle_event`]), so taps, typing, focus and scrolling
//! reach the card's widgets and its handlers run. Its `host.request` calls
//! leave through the Card runner's own path (`octosense_appstore::services::
//! pump`: the isolate's capability gate, then the host services) as that
//! app, the way the app's own UI calls go out. A service sheet a tile's call
//! raises is not shown on the tile. The shell keeps one affordance of its
//! own on each tile, the open button at its top-right corner
//! ([`open_button`]), which opens the app.
//!
//! **L0 taps.** A lowered L0 card's taps and field edits call `NAV(t:
//! "l0:{e,k,v}", v?)` (Octoscript-Makepad's general translation). Every
//! isolate gets a host `NAV` ([`install_nav`]) that queues the call with the
//! isolate's heap key; nothing else reads it. The card window
//! (glance_sheet.rs), the desktop's glance panel (glance_panel.rs) and the
//! phone's glance page (mobile_pages.rs `GlanceCards`) keep their L0 cards
//! in a [`LiveCards`], one path for all three: a tile's own isolate's calls
//! ([`take_taps`], never another tile's) run through its card's
//! [`L0Session`], made for the app that published the card: the declared
//! transition (`octoscript_ui_l0` dispatch), the §5.12 writes the host
//! performs (a `sys.chat` append, glance_chat.rs), and a re-lowering. On the
//! phone the shell first drops a card's clicks ([`drop_clicks`]) when the
//! finger was no plain tap on that card: a page swipe, a pull, a long press.
