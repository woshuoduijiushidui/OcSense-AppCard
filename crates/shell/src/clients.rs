//! Client processes and the app-launching model, behavior read from
//! omarchy's source (local/agent_state/wm/omarchy-launch-model.md):
//!
//! - the terminal is ALWAYS a fresh instance, opened in the cwd of the
//!   focused terminal (omarchy-launch-terminal + omarchy-cmd-terminal-cwd;
//!   our children report pwd over OSC 7 -> Layer B custom message),
//! - other apps use launch-or-focus: `\b<pattern>\b` case-insensitive
//!   against window class OR title focuses an existing window, else spawns
//!   (bin/omarchy-launch-or-focus).
//!
//! Children are Makepad apps launched with `--stdin-loop` and
//! `STUDIO_HOST`/`STUDIO_BUILD` pointing at the in-process hub, exactly
//! like studio launches run targets.
//!
//! **They are built before they start** (`cargo build --release`, see
//! [`launch_plan`]) whenever the shell runs out of a checkout, so a stale
//! or missing binary is rebuilt on launch instead of failing or showing
//! yesterday's app; a native app from the OctoSense workspace, held to its
//! `Cargo.lock`. The build runs outside any sandbox, in its checkout, and
//! its "Compiling …" output lands in the client's log; then the built
//! binary itself starts under the app's sandbox ([`ClientSlot::continue_launch`]).
//! Cargo never starts the app (no `cargo run`): what the app can write never
//! decides what the next build runs. An installed shell with no checkout
//! around it starts the sibling binary.
