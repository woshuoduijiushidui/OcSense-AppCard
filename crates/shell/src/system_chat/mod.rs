//! The system chat: the person's conversation with the system agent
//! (`_main:api:octosense#system`), inside the shell (ADR 0004 §6, §8,
//! §12; docs/architecture.md, "Agents").
//!
//! | Part | Module |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | the conversation as frames make it: streamed text, tool calls, questions, approvals, history | [`model`] |
//! | the session driver: open, hydrate, turns, interrupt, new conversation, reconnect and resume | [`session`] |
//! | its link: the shell's one kernel through `octosense_ai_host::kernel` | `link` (with a kernel) |
//! | Setup → Assistant → Command execution: the grant, the person's gesture, restart to apply | [`grants`] |
//! | the pane (desktop side panel, phone full screen) | [`view`] |
//! | its prompt: text input, the input method, the pane's keys | [`composer`] |
//! | Markdown in the replies, as the pane draws it | [`markdown`] |
//!
//! **Where it runs.** A thread owns the [`session::Driver`] and its link;
//! the UI thread sends it [`session::Command`]s and draws a snapshot of the
//! model. The chat connects when the pane opens and lets the connection go
//! when it closes with nothing running, so the kernel's idle stop still
//! works.
//!
//! **Approvals.** Every `approval/requested` of a turn this chat started
//! goes to the shell's approval router ([`crate::approvals`]) as the system
//! agent's call, batched per request (the turn; its prompt is the plan),
//! with the id `syschat:<approval id>`; the router's decisions come back
//! through [`crate::approvals::take_system_chat_decisions`] and only then
//! does the chat answer the kernel. The pane never approves anything.
//!
//! The kernel also delivers approvals of OTHER clients' turns on the same
//! session (Talk to Octos): those are external. They go to the router as
//! [`crate::approvals::Caller::External`] on an external connection, which
//! holds and answers nothing (no developer mode, no rule, no sheet); the
//! pane shows them read-only and the chat never answers them.
//!
//! **App agents' questions.** A question an app's agent asks on a turn the
//! system agent started (`peer/input`, ADR 0004 §6) is the system chat's:
//! the chat subscribes to [`crate::questions`] and shows each one in its
//! conversation (ids `routed:<n>`); the person's answer goes back through
//! [`crate::questions::answer`], never through this chat's own session.
