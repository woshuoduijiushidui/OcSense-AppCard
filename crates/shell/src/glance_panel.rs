//! The desktop's glance panel: the cards apps published to the glance
//! screen (glance.rs), in a column at the right edge of the desk, over the
//! windows, the way the phone shows them on its glance page.
//!
//! F9 (or `--test-action glance`) shows and hides it. Each card is live: the
//! panel hands it the pointer inside its tile and every other event
//! (typing, focus, timers, answers), so it works as it does in its app
//! (glance_card.rs). A card takes the shell's light or dark palette unless
//! it names a theme of its own.
//!
//! - **A card's own controls** (its chips, buttons and fields) work in place.
//!   A press anywhere else on it opens the card in the card window
//!   ([`ShellGlancePanelAction::OpenCard`]), as its notification does. A
//!   field claims its press; a chip (a tap target, `OctoscriptTap`) claims
//!   none and calls its card once the release's handlers have run, so a
//!   release is held for a frame: a click from that card means its control
//!   had it.
//! - **The hovered card** shows its actions over its top-right corner, on a
//!   backdrop: open the app that published it, and dismiss the card. They
//!   are not drawn over every card's content all the time.
//! - **The header** says how many cards there are and has Clear all and the
//!   panel's close; a click outside the column closes it too. With no card
//!   it says so ("You're all caught up").
//! - **The list** starts at the top and the wheel moves it a card at a time;
//!   a new card scrolls it no further than shows that card
//!   ([`first_to_reveal`]). "More above" heads the list and "more below"
//!   ends it; the card that does not fit whole peeks in above that line,
//!   cut at the list's end.
//! - **A card taller than its tile** (the cap, glance_card.rs) scrolls
//!   inside it ([`TileScroll`]), with a thumb at its edge. A card with an
//!   in-card chat (`sys.chat`) sits at its newest rows and follows them as
//!   the conversation grows, so its field and the latest exchange stay in
//!   view; any other card starts at its top. The wheel over such a card
//!   scrolls it first and moves the list only at its ends. The tile's own
//!   layout scrolls, so a press the card's controls do not claim still
//!   opens the card window.
//! - **A dismissal** (a card's close, Delete, Clear all) can be undone: the
//!   shell's toast offers Undo ([`ShellGlancePanelAction::Dismissed`]), and
//!   ⌘Z does it while the panel holds the keyboard.
//! - **The keyboard** ([`ShellGlancePanel::key`]): opened by the person, the
//!   panel holds it. The arrows move a focus ring from card to card,
//!   scrolling as they go, Return opens the card, Delete dismisses it and
//!   Esc closes the panel. Opened by a new card it does not take the
//!   keyboard from what the person was typing in; a press in it does, and
//!   a press on a card's own control hands it to that control.
//!
//! It slides in from the right as it opens ([`crate::shell::ui::slide`]),
//! and its column stops above the dock. While it is open, toasts stack left
//! of it. The column is [`PANEL_WIDTH`]
//! wide, as wide as a toast; each card is a tile of the column's inner width
//! at its measured height (glance_card.rs), in the glance order (priority,
//! then recency).
