//! `octos` for contained apps: the Card runner's assistant service.
//!
//! A store app (an App Hub bundle the Card runner hosts) that declares
//! `octos.*` services calls `host.request("octos.turn.start", {text}, …)`.
//! The isolate's gate already refused every service the manifest did not
//! declare; what reaches this service is handed to ONE octos peer per app,
//! owned by the shell's system agent on the shell's kernel — the same
//! host-owned peer contract Rinx uses (ADR 0007), named `card.<app id>` so a
//! store app can never share a native module's peer or memory.
//!
//! The app and its cards talk in the app's conversation (ADR 0004 §6,
//! 2026-09-29): the person's lane, a request context of the peer that
//! shares history with the peer's own session (the system agent's lane),
//! the two running in parallel. A turn is the person's (`origin: person`,
//! labelled with the app) unless the app says it started the run itself
//! (`trigger: app`); `octos.session.history` is both lanes' transcripts
//! merged by time, each message with its `lane` and speaker. A script app
//! gets no pushed events: it reads the whole conversation, the system
//! agent's turns included, with history.
//!
//! What an app sends is input text (and what started the turn) only. It
//! never names a session, profile, workspace or provider, and it cannot
//! decide a tool approval: the shell's approval router draws every one
//! (ADR 0004 §8).
//!
//! **Consent and grants** (ADR 0004 §4). The service follows
//! [`crate::Policy::contained_gate`]: behind the person's consent at first
//! use (the shipped default), off, or on for every app (the developer
//! override `OCTOSENSE_CONTAINED_APPS=1`). An app's peer is granted only
//! the `octos.*` services its manifest declares ([`declared`]), and turning
//! its agent off in Settings releases the live peer at once ([`revoke`]).
//!
//! **An agent for every app that declares one** (ADR 0004 §4). A script
//! app's peer does not wait for the app to call `octos`: once the person
//! allowed its agent, the shell prepares it ([`prepare`]: `peer/prepare`,
//! its tools registered), so the system agent's `peer_list` shows it and
//! `peer_send_input` reaches it, and the shell's "Ask <app>" panel opens
//! the app's conversation on it ([`conversation`]). The app's own `octos`
//! calls use the same peer, still gated by the services its manifest
//! declares; an app that declares none (News: it ships `tools.json` only)
//! never calls it, and has its agent all the same.
//!
//! The logic does not need a kernel: peers come from a [`PeerFactory`]. The
//! shell's factory (`cfg(kernel)`) launches them through
//! `octosense_app_peers::hosted`; tests use a fake one.
