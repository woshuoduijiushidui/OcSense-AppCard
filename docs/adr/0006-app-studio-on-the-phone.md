# ADR 0006: App Studio on the phone

- **Date:** 2026-10-02
- **Status:** Accepted (2026-10-03). Implementation has not started; milestone 1 comes first.
- **Scope:** How an agent on the phone turns an image (a generated design or a screenshot of an existing app) into an OctoSense app or glance card, looks at its own result and improves it, entirely on the phone, at first in developer mode. Covers the inputs, the in-process renderer, the checks, the rules that can change without a build, the tools agents get, and what of the OctoScript App Design Flow moves to the phone. There is no compile in the loop and no Mac.
- **Relates to:** [ADR 0002](0002-event-driven-app-agents.md) (§6 the `card_render` and `card_critique_payload` toolbox tools; §7 a card is rendered, critiqued and revised before it is published; milestone M6); [ADR 0004](0004-native-apps-hosting-and-peers.md) (app agents, host tools, approvals, §13 developer mode); [ADR 0005](0005-app-contract.md) (the app contract and bundles); [Home ADR 0004](home/0004-system-apps-are-contained-script-apps.md) (contained script apps); [Home ADR 0005](home/0005-settings-octoscript-controller.md) and [Home ADR 0006](home/0006-builtin-settings.md) (Settings and its developer options); App Hub's [`card-studio`](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub/tree/main/crates/card-studio) crate and [skill](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub/tree/main/skills/card-studio); the [OctoScript App Design Flow](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoScript-App-Design-Flow) (`flows/image-to-card`, `flows/image-lib`); octos issue #1149, closed, which added the `image_generation` stub (its backend needs a new issue).

## Context

Making an OctoSense app or card from a picture works today only on a desktop:

- **The OctoScript App Design Flow** is about 12,150 lines of Python tooling (about 16,000 with its tests), plus per-app examples. It runs on a Mac with cargo, Makepad Studio and App Hub's `card-host --remote`, and also needs Python 3.12 with numpy, OpenCV, Pillow and fontTools, Swift and Node. Its two image paths are:
  - the Sketch kit (`flows/kits/sketch`), which needs `sketchtool`, Swift and a licensed kit, and has its own gates (`gate_structure`, `gate_composition`, `gate_fill`, `gate_visual`);
  - image-to-card (`flows/image-to-card`, `flows/image-lib`): crop scenes from an image, read their text with Apple Vision OCR (through Swift), map regions to widgets, generate L0, render and compare. Its gate is `flows/image-lib/gate.py`: native geometry, OCR text, ink and colour checks, and the visual-review receipt.
- **App Hub's `card-studio`** renders a card in a hidden `card-host --remote`, grabs a PNG, runs measured checks (hidden, clipped or truncated text, overflow, overlap, empty or failed states, fit, lint, realize) and builds a critique payload for a vision model. The checks and the payload are plain Rust that depends only on serde and serde_json. They read the remote instrument's snapshot and dump formats and card-host's widget ids, and the critique prompt is written for an L0 glance card. The rendering needs the remote instrument and a separate process.

On the phone none of that runs:

- There is no Python, and no Apple Vision for OCR.
- Makepad's remote instrument is compiled out on Android (`platform/src/remote.rs`, the `target_os = "android"` stub), and there is no second process to host a card.
- Agents cannot reach a loopback port anyway: octos's `web_fetch` and MCP over HTTP refuse private addresses.

What the phone already has:

- **Offscreen rendering and pixel readback.** Makepad's GLES backend, which the Home APK uses, draws a pass into a texture and reads it back asynchronously (`Texture::read_back`, for `RenderBGRAu8` textures; on GLES the bytes come back as premultiplied RGBA with a top-left origin). The shell already uses that chain on Android for its `capture:`/`record:` test actions: it reads back the focused app's offscreen frame and encodes the PNG with makepad's own encoder (`Cx::encode_rgba_as_png`). Capturing the whole window, which AppCard's monitor relied on, is not implemented on Android's GLES backend.
- **The real lowering.** [`glance_card.rs`](../../crates/shell/src/glance_card.rs) lowers an L0 card the way the glance tile shows it (the shell's kit, theme fonts, multi-line fields, height `Fit`) and runs it in a Splash isolate under the app's policy. A published tile first passes `check_level`, `resolve_digests` and the chat seed, and light or dark comes from a process-wide flag. A card bundle lowers with its own `kit/` in App Hub's Card runner. App Hub's `card-studio` uses neither path exactly: its glance size is a provisional 350×160, while the tile is the page width minus 40 pt wide and 72–440 pt tall.
- **Agent tools.**
  - The system agent has `view_image` ([`system_tools.rs`](../../crates/kernel/src/system_tools.rs)).
  - App agents in developer mode get a fixed set of kernel tools, among them `write_file`, `edit_file`, `apply_patch` and `view_image`, plus `dev.run` and every app's shareable tools ([`relay.rs`](../../crates/shell/src/host_tools/relay.rs)). Developer mode also answers every approval itself ([`dev_mode.rs`](../../crates/shell/src/dev_mode.rs)).
  - Host-tool results are text only, so an image reaches the model only through a file in the agent's workspace and `view_image`.
- **Rules that change without a build.** The [system toolbox](../../crates/toolbox) runs Octoscript templates: built-in ones locked by digest, and editable copies under the app's folder that are re-checked on load and can never widen their modules or budgets.
- **Screen access on the OctoSense ROM.** The agent service ([`IAgentPlatform.aidl`](../../rom/vendor/octosense/agent/src/dev/makepad/octosense/agent/IAgentPlatform.aidl)) accepts only platform-signed OctoSense packages, Home among them, and can:
  - capture the screen (`captureScreen`); with the default capture arguments, windows an app marks secure are left out;
  - list tasks and return a task's last snapshot (`getTasks`, `getTaskSnapshot`);
  - start an app (`startActivity`, `startTask`);
  - inject input (`tap`, `swipe`, `typeText`, `pressKey`), which it refuses while the keyguard is showing. `captureScreen` and `startActivity` do not check the keyguard.
- **No image generation yet.** octos registers an `image_generation` tool but binds no backend, so every call fails with `no_backend_bound`. The tool is on no client's tool list: not octos's external clients', not the system agent's, not the developer app agents'.
- **No developer mode on a phone today.** A development build (`cfg(dev_mode)`) honours it from Settings; a release build only with the `--dev-grant-all` launch flag, which a phone cannot pass. The Home APK is built `--release` without the feature. In a home with real accounts developer mode ends after 8 hours; only a home marked as a developer profile keeps it ([`dev_mode.rs`](../../crates/shell/src/dev_mode.rs)). A phone has one home.

For many people the phone is the only computer they have. An agent that can make and refine its own apps there should not need a Mac or a server.

## Decision

### 1. An App Studio that runs on the phone, developer mode first

The whole loop runs on the device:

1. **Take an image.**
2. **Draft** an app or card.
3. **Render** it the way its real surface will show it.
4. **Check** it.
5. **Compare** it with the image.
6. **Critique** it with the agent's own vision.
7. **Edit** it, then render again.

There is no compile in the loop and no Mac or server anywhere. The first release is gated to developer mode (section 8). Normal mode follows once approvals cover screen capture and installs.

### 2. The input is an image; there is no Sketch path on the phone

An image comes from one of two places.

- **Generated designs.** The person, or the agent, asks for a design. Generation goes through a provider the person configured in AI providers, and the PNG lands in the studio project's folder. octos's `image_generation` tool gets this backend instead of a separate OctoSense tool, and joins the tool lists that need it (octos's external clients, the system agent, developer app agents), so every client sees one tool. The person types the image provider's key on AI providers' host sheet, and it is kept like every provider key, where the kernel reads it: in the profile's `env_vars` on a phone (app-private, mode 0600), behind a `keychain:` marker on a desktop. octos's backend resolves it from there as it resolves an LLM key, and no app ever sees it.
- **Screenshots of existing apps, to clone them.**
  - On every phone, the person picks screenshots with the system document picker, as AI providers' QR import does (one PNG or JPEG at a time today; picking several is new), or shares images to OctoSense (Home's share target accepts only text today; image shares are new).
  - On the OctoSense ROM, in developer mode and after the person approves a capture session, the studio drives the agent service. It opens the app (`startActivity`), walks its screens (`tap`, `swipe`) and captures each one (`captureScreen`). A session is bound to one app and ends when another app comes to the front. It only navigates, never types (`typeText` is not used), refuses to start or continue while the phone is locked, and shows a stop control the person can use at any time.
  - On stock Android, a capture session through MediaProjection, with Android's own consent prompt, comes later.

The Sketch kit, its gates included, stays a desktop tool and is not ported.

### 3. The output is a glance card or a contained script app

- **A glance card:** L0 only, as for every generated card, published through `glance.publish` as the app.
- **A script app:** a bundle per [ADR 0005](0005-app-contract.md), with `main.splash`, Octoscript controllers, its kit and its data. In developer mode it installs locally as a developer bundle. App Hub installs only from the signed catalog today, so this adds a local install path: a developer bundle carries developer mode's `DevTag`, runs only while that tag is valid, and is never offered through the catalog. Publishing goes through App Hub's usual gate and signing.

A cloned app is the person's own prototype. Section 9 says what may and may not be copied.

### 4. The shell renders in process, on the target surface's own path

A new renderer in the shell (`crates/shell/src/studio/`) renders a card or one screen of an app into an offscreen pass. It uses exactly the lowering and size of the surface it is meant for:

- the glance tile through the tile's whole path (`check_level`, `resolve_digests`, the chat seed, then `glance_card::lower`), at the tile's real width and height bounds, in light or dark mode. Lowering takes the mode as a parameter instead of reading the shell's process-wide dark flag, so a studio render never re-lowers live tiles;
- a bundle's screen through the bundle's own kit, as App Hub's Card runner lowers it, at the phone's window size.

It then:

1. waits until the render settles: no resource still loading for that isolate, every shader compiled (`is_draw_shader_window_ready`), the draw list quiet for a few frames after a repaint the renderer requests itself, and a hard timeout (an animated card reports `settled: false`);
2. reads the pixels back, one readback at a time (makepad's 32 MiB readback budget is shared by every pending readback), composes the premultiplied RGBA onto the surface's backdrop and writes an opaque PNG;
3. builds the widget-tree capture the checks read, in the capture format `card-studio` reads (section 5).

There is no remote instrument, no `card-host` process and no window grab. Studio renders never go through the glance store, so its publish rate and card limits do not apply. Script cards render under a no-side-effect policy: a `host.request` that would change something is refused during a studio render.

### 5. Checks and comparison are Rust, shared by phone and desktop

App Hub's `card-studio` becomes the one implementation of checks, comparison and the critique payload. Both the desktop `card-host` path and the phone's in-process renderer feed it.

- Its process-and-remote rendering goes behind a desktop feature.
- Its capture layer, which today parses the remote instrument's snapshot and dump and card-host's widget ids, becomes an interface both renderers fill.
- `realize_report` moves out of `card-host`, so both renderers write the same report.
- Check thresholds move into a JSON config, so they can change without a build.
- The critique payload gets a prompt for app screens beside the one for glance cards.
- **New checks** computed from the read-back pixels: text contrast per text rectangle, and empty or failed images.
- **Comparison with the source image:** layout bands, colour and fill, and crops of disputed regions. These are ported from image-to-card's `compare_screens` and image-lib's `gate.py` (native geometry, ink and colour), with bands sized for each surface instead of one 812×1552 page.
- **Text in the source image** needs OCR, which the phone lacks. Until an on-device OCR is chosen (open questions), text checks against the source image are skipped and the agent's own critique covers text.

### 6. The rules and the loop are Octoscript, editable without compiling

The system toolbox's runner becomes the studio runner.

- **Templates:** built-in templates are locked by digest. A project's copies are edited by the agent with `write_file` and re-checked on load. They cannot widen their modules or budgets.
- **A new `mod.studio` host module** gives templates:
  - files confined to the project folder;
  - `sha256` and the clock;
  - render, check, compare and critique-payload calls;
  - L0 check and realize as JSON;
  - SVG checks, image size, cropping and PNG encoding.

  Large results are written to files and passed back as paths, because Octoscript's JSON values are capped at 64 KiB.
- **What moves from the design flow to Octoscript** (rules and text, not pixels):
  - the role-first mapping policy (`semantics`, `core/policy`);
  - review records;
  - the code generation of image-to-card (`compile`, `extract`, `register`), without its desktop assumptions: fonts read from a `splash-makepad` checkout, artwork fetched from a local server, and the single 406×776 artboard;
  - repair plans.
- **What moves to Rust** (in `card-studio`):
  - pixel work, including `extract`'s crop and `core/policy`'s crop comparison;
  - the geometry, ink and colour checks of `image-lib/gate.py`;
  - the journaled multi-file commit of a repair (`core/repair`);
  - bundle export.
- **What stays on the desktop:** the Sketch kit's gates (`gate_structure`, `gate_composition`, `gate_fill`, `gate_visual`, and `visual_evidence`, which `gate_visual` uses).
- **Octoscript itself gains** `sort` and number formatting for scripts. L0 cards already format numbers with `format:`. Regex and file access stay out, as Octoscript's security model has them; the five simple patterns in the ported code become character checks.

### 7. Agents drive the loop through host tools

Host tools on the shell:

- `studio.render`, `studio.check`, `studio.compare`, `studio.critique_payload` and `studio.bundle_check`, declared `risk: read`;
- `studio.install`, for a developer bundle, declared `risk: act`, because it changes what is installed.

None is a background tool, because a render needs Home in front (section 10). Each registers a call timeout that covers settle and readback; octos's default is 30 s.

Every tool writes its results into the calling context's folder and returns their paths. For an app agent in a conversation context that is `contexts/<id>/`, the only folder its `view_image` can read. The arguments name files in that folder (host-tool arguments are capped at 64 KiB), so iterations are `edit_file` calls on the project's sources.

The agent looks at renders with `view_image` and critiques with its own model:

- It views a render and its source in the same step, because a viewed image reaches the model for one request only.
- If an image does not reach the model, the loop stops and says so instead of critiquing blind. That happens when `view_image` returns `shown_to_model: false`, or when the provider refuses images, after which octos tells the model the image could not be shown.
- On the phone the model is DeepSeek V4 Flash. Its API takes images: on 2026-10-03 a PNG sent as an `image_url` part was described correctly, for about 200 prompt tokens at 64×64. Milestone 1 tests whether octos passes a viewed image through to it (`shown_to_model`) and whether its vision is good enough to critique UI.
- `model.complete` takes no images and is not used for critique.

Who gets the tools, in the first release only while developer mode is on:

- **The system agent:** through the same interception as `agents.*`.
- **App agents:** as a new developer-mode grant (section 8).

An octos change adds a media field to `peer/tool/result`, mapped onto octos's internal `ToolResult::model_media`, so a host-tool result can carry an image and the second call goes away. Until then `view_image` on the returned path is the route.

### 8. Developer mode for the studio

- **The developer build.** Home is built with `--features dev-mode`, through a new `--dev-mode` option of [`build-home.py`](../../rom/scripts/build-home.py). Its existing `--development` option only picks the signing keystore. On the ROM the developer build is platform-signed, because the agent service accepts only platform-signed OctoSense packages.
- **The person's own home keeps its 8-hour limit.** The studio never marks a home that holds real accounts as a developer profile. A persistent developer profile on the phone needs a second home with test accounts, as ADR 0004 §13 intends; how the phone hosts one is open.
- **One new grant.** Developer mode gives app agents the `studio.*` tools.
- **One exception to ADR 0004 §13.** A capture session's approval is a new approval kind that developer mode never answers by itself. The person answers it once per session, because the session sees other apps' screens, and the answer goes to the developer-mode audit log.

### 9. Privacy, safety and other people's work

- **Screenshots can hold personal data.** They stay in the project's folder and are sent only to the model provider the person chose. Deleting a project deletes its folder and purges the conversation sessions that viewed its images, because octos keeps viewed images as message media.
- **Other apps are captured only in an approved session** started by the person (section 2). A session is visible on screen, never runs in the background, and leaves secure windows out.
- **A clone is for the person's own use or as a prototype.** Studio projects never ship logos, brand marks, icons or copyrighted images in a bundle. The studio records where every image came from, and `studio.bundle_check` refuses any raster asset derived from a captured screenshot. The studio regenerates or draws artwork instead. Publishing a clone needs the publisher's own assets and goes through App Hub's review.
- **Generated cards stay L0** and script apps stay contained. The studio widens no policy.

### 10. Limits on the device

- **The screen must be on.** Makepad paints only while Home has a drawable surface, and without one a readback does not fail; it waits. The renderer watches for Home going to the background, cancels the readback and fails the render with `not_foreground`. Rendering in the background needs makepad changes, a surfaceless or pbuffer EGL context and its drawable-surface checks; that stays an open question.
- **Size and memory.** A glance tile reads back from under 1 MB to about 8 MB of RGBA, depending on its height and the screen's density. A full app screen reads back 10–18 MB, which reserves 19–25 MiB of the 32 MiB readback budget once rows are padded, so renders run one at a time. PNGs for `view_image` stay under 5 MiB and are scaled down if needed.
- **Vulkan.** On Android, readback is implemented for GLES only. A Vulkan build of Home would need Vulkan readback first.

## What changes where

| Where | Change | Size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| makepad | Nothing for the first release. Later: Vulkan readback; background rendering; optionally the remote instrument on Android, for debugging from a desktop | — |
| App Hub `card-studio` | Library split; a capture interface both renderers fill; shared `realize_report`; thresholds as JSON; an app-screen critique prompt; contrast, image and comparison checks | M |
| App Hub installs | A local developer-install path for `DevTag` bundles | S |
| OctoSense shell | `studio/` renderer and one router for texture readbacks; lowering that takes light or dark as a parameter; the host tools; capture sessions on the ROM and their approval kind; developer installs; image shares and picking several images | L |
| OctoSense toolbox | Generalised into the studio runner; `mod.studio`; the first templates | M |
| Octoscript | `sort`, number formatting for scripts | S |
| octos | An `image_generation` backend (a new issue; #1149 is closed); the tool on the external-client list; a media field on `peer/tool/result` | M |
| Phone packaging | The developer build (`--dev-mode`), platform-signed on the ROM | S |
| App Design Flow | The Sketch kit and its gates stay on the desktop; image-to-card Python retires as each part lands on the phone | — |

## Milestones

1. **Render on the phone.** Renderer, readback router, `studio.render`, developer build. Verified on a device: pixels and orientation, settle timing, cost of the repaint, the readback when Home leaves the front, and an image reaching DeepSeek V4 Flash (`shown_to_model`).
2. **Check and compare.** `card-studio` as a library, the new checks, comparison with a screenshot, the OCR choice. End-to-end: a screenshot of an app becomes a glance card refined in three iterations.
3. **Rules in Octoscript.** The studio runner and `mod.studio`; the `card-refine` template; image-to-card code generation; script-app output and developer install.
4. **Images in.** The image-generation backend; capture sessions on the ROM; clone a multi-screen app from captured screens.
5. **Normal mode.** Approvals for capture and install; MediaProjection on stock Android; background rendering if it is solved.

## Consequences

- One implementation of checks and comparison for desktop and phone, so a card judged on a Mac and on a phone gets the same report.
- The design flow's Python shrinks to the Sketch kit and desktop-only tools as the image-to-card parts move to Octoscript and Rust.
- The shell gains a renderer that can show any card offscreen. It is a new attack surface for script cards, which is why studio renders run without side effects.
- Rules and templates change on the phone without a build, under the toolbox's digest and budget rules.
- Developer mode gains the `studio.*` tools and one approval it never answers by itself.
- ADR 0002 is amended (its amendment of 2026-10-03): its §6 toolbox tools `card_render` and `card_critique_payload` become the `studio.*` host tools, and its §7 rule that the phone evaluates only while charging does not apply to renders the person starts.

## Open questions

- Which image-generation providers and models to offer first, and what a generation costs.
- Whether DeepSeek V4 Flash's vision is good enough to critique UI, and which model requirement a studio project declares otherwise.
- Which OCR reads a source image's text on the phone.
- How the phone hosts a second home with test accounts, for a persistent developer profile.
- How App Hub treats a published app that began as a clone.
- Background rendering without a surface.
- The comparison thresholds that mean "close enough" to a screenshot.
