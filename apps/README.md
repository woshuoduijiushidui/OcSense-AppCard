# OctoSense system apps

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

**New to the code?** Read the [desktop, Home, ROM and system-app walkthrough](../desktop/docs/code-walkthrough.md), then the [agent and Tokio walkthrough](../docs/architecture-walkthrough.md). The first follows launch, native hosting, script bundles, app data and Android platform boundaries.

> **Where this fits.** System apps run in App Hub's Card runner. News, Mail, Calendar, Photos, Maps, YouTube and Camera declare app agents; AI providers configures the host and declares none. The shell gives each enabled app/account its own peer and drives its conversations for the system agent, the “Ask <app>” panel and in-card chat. Declared tools pass through the shell's relay and approval router to a host service; the shell's shared notice service handles apps that only expose `<namespace>.notify`. See [App agents](#app-agents) for the exact tools and [architecture](../docs/architecture.md) for the two lanes and trust boundaries. Glance accepts L0 and Splash cards under the publishing app's policy.

The first-party apps that ship with [OctoSense](https://github.com/OctoSense-org),
the agent shell on top of your operating system, and the host services behind
them. They live in `apps/` of the [OctoSense repository](../README.md); until
2026-09-27 they were the OctoSense-System-Apps repository (archived).

- **News, Photos, Maps, Camera, Mail, Calendar, AI providers and YouTube** are *contained script apps*. Each is
  a Makepad Script/Splash program in a `bundle/`, run by App Hub's Card runner
  in its own isolate, under the permissions admitted from its `manifest.json`. That is the same containment a store app gets. They are also worked
  examples of the app shape any developer publishes through the App Hub.
- **Mail's host service** (`mail/host-service`) is the Rust half of Mail:
  IMAP/POP3/SMTP, the account store and the sign-in sheet, run by the shell.
  The app gets mail, never a password or a socket. It also runs Mail's
  agent's tool `mail.notify`, which puts a notice card on the glance screen.
- **Calendar's host service** (`calendar/host-service`) keeps Calendar's
  events in the host's directory and runs Calendar's agent's tools:
  `calendar.events`, `add_event`, `remove_event`, and `notify` and `agenda`,
  which put an event or agenda card on the glance screen. Calendar is a
  desktop system app (`desktop/system-apps.json`).
- **News's host service** (`news/host-service`) collects News's stories on a
  timer, with no model, and runs News's agent tools `news.list`, `news.read`
  and `news.notify` (the shell draws the notice).
- **The `llm` host service** (`ai-providers/host-service`) is the Rust half
  of AI providers: the assistant's LLM providers over octos's model catalog,
  keys in the platform secret store, Test connection, and moving providers
  between devices by a PIN-protected `OCTOS1E` QR (camera, image or paste).
  Keys are typed and QRs drawn only on the host's own sheets; the app sees
  masked status.
- **AppCard** (`appcard`) is an optional native app: the "Ask anything"
  assistant, a Rust module (`octos-app`) that the shells link in-process and
  that runs on the shell's octos kernel. It is **opt-in**: both shells link
  it only with `--features app-appcard`, and it is not shipped by default.
- **Reference** (`reference`): a Rust module the shells link behind
  `app-reference` (always on phones). Every native app the shells link is
  declared in [`../native-apps.json`](../native-apps.json). News, Photos and
  Maps are script apps only: their earlier native modules were deleted
  (native-apps ADR 0004 §1, [#113](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense/pull/113)). Photos' sample library, which Home mounts, is in
  `photos/resources/`.

The shell services these apps rely on are next door:
[`../crates/kernel`](../crates/kernel) (the octos kernel service, see
[The octos kernel](#the-octos-kernel)) and
[`../crates/app-peers`](../crates/app-peers) (apps' access to the assistant).

Rules for agents working here are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and
[appcard/AGENTS.md](appcard/AGENTS.md), on top of the repository's
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

**Building your own app?** You do not need to build or change this
repository. Start at the [OctoSense-org profile](https://github.com/OctoSense-org)'s
reading list (OctoScript-App-Design-Flow's `AGENTS.md`, then
`docs/QUICKSTART.md`), and read the bundles here as worked examples
(`apps/<name>/bundle/main.splash`). To run one next to your app, clone the
OctoSense repository into the same workspace and, from
OctoScript-App-Design-Flow:
`tools/octo run ../OctoSense/apps/photos/bundle --system --no-stamp --app-data /tmp/sys-apps`
(`--no-stamp` leaves the checkout unmodified; Mail needs a shell, see below).

## The apps

| App | Id | What it does | Capabilities (manifest) | Network hosts (manifest) | Host services |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [News](news/bundle) | `os.news` | Hacker News, TechMeme and Google News feeds in tabs (Today, HN, TechMeme, Google, Saved), with a reader for stories | `storage`, `net`, `images`, `web`, `news`, `glance` | `hn.algolia.com`, `www.techmeme.com`, `news.google.com`, `api.gdeltproject.org`, `feeds.bbci.co.uk`, `feeds.npr.org`, `www.theguardian.com`, `feeds.arstechnica.com` | [`news`](news/host-service) |
| [Photos](photos/bundle) | `os.photos` | A sample library: moments, albums, people, favorites, a grid with selection, a full-screen viewer | `storage`, `glance` | none | `photos.notify` via the shell notice service (full-size photos use the asset mount) |
| [Maps](maps/bundle) | `os.maps` | `MapView` map, place search, places, routes with a changeable start and up to two stops, and a drive mode with turn-by-turn and a 2D/3D view; starts at the device's GPS fix when there is one | `storage`, `net`, `location`, `glance` | `photon.komoot.io`, `router.project-osrm.org`, `overpass-api.de`, `overpass.kumi.systems`, `maps.mail.ru`, `overpass.openstreetmap.fr` | `maps.notify` via the shell notice service |
| [Camera](camera/bundle) | `os.camera` (Home) | Photo and video over the runtime's `CameraPreview` widget, flash and zoom, a thumbnail of the last shot and a viewer | `storage`, `camera`, `microphone`, `library`, `glance` | none | `camera.notify` via the shell notice service |
| [Mail](mail/bundle) | `os.mail` | Accounts, folders, message list, reader (HTML rebuilt by the service) and composer; its agent puts notice cards on the glance screen (`mail.notify`) | `storage`, `mail`, `glance` | none (the service connects, not the app) | [`mail`](mail/host-service) |
| [AI providers](ai-providers/bundle) | `os.ai-providers` | The assistant's LLM providers: a primary and fallbacks, each with a model pull-down from octos's catalog and Test connection; an add wizard (family, model, route, key, test); Show QR for phone and import by camera, image or paste | `storage`, `llm` | none (the service connects, not the app) | [`llm`](ai-providers/host-service) |
| [YouTube](youtube/bundle) | `os.youtube` | YouTube search (the runtime's keyless `sys.video`, which reads YouTube's own results page), result rows with thumbnails and LIVE or length badges, topic chips, playback of YouTube's mobile watch page in `WebReader`, and a history of what was played on this device | `storage`, `net`, `glance` | `www.youtube.com`, `m.youtube.com`, `i.ytimg.com` | `youtube.notify` via the shell notice service |
| [Calendar](calendar/bundle) | `os.calendar` (desktop) | Its agent keeps the person's events and puts event and agenda cards on the glance screen; its own window cannot list the events yet (it needs an App Hub `calendar` capability) | `storage`, `glance` | none | [`calendar`](calendar/host-service) (for Calendar's agent only) |
| [AppCard](appcard) | native, opt-in | The AppCard assistant: a routing brain picks or composes an app agent, which generates a live Splash or webview card. Shells link it only with `app-appcard`; not shipped by default | n/a (not a bundle) | n/a | the shell's octos kernel |

What each capability means is defined by App Hub's closed list
(`KNOWN_CAPABILITIES` in `crates/app-policy/src/manifest.rs`): `images` shows
pictures from any public https host, `web` opens a page in the system WebView,
`library` offers captures to the system photo library, `mail` reaches the
host's mail service, `llm` reaches the host's LLM-provider service, `news`
reads the host's news service, `glance` publishes cards to the glance
screen. `net` reaches only the hosts the manifest lists.

### Status and known gaps

- **YouTube**: on the OnePlus 6 (2026-09-27) search, results, playback and
  history worked; closing the player ends the page (makepad#43, in the
  runtime). Playback opens YouTube's mobile watch page, which autoplays muted
  and shows its own "Open App" prompt. Search reads YouTube's results page and
  depends on its layout.
- **Camera**: on the OnePlus 6 test run (2026-09-25) Camera captured a photo
  and released the camera in the background, but the live preview drew pure
  black; unresolved. Desktop builds have no camera and the Android emulator
  refuses one, so capture is untested elsewhere.
- **Photos**: the bundle ships only 75 thumbnails (`bundle/thumbs/`, about
  2 MB). The full-size files the viewer shows are served at
  `{{assets}}/photos/...` only when a shell mounts them: Home mounts
  `photos/resources/photos` (about 87 MB, `phone/system-apps.json`);
  the desktop mounts nothing (`desktop/system-apps.json`), so the viewer has
  no full-size image there.
- **Maps**: on the OnePlus 6 (2026-09-27) search, place, route, adding and
  removing a stop, driving with turn-by-turn and the 2D view worked. The 3D
  drive view draws the route but no map tiles, on the phone and on the
  desktop, before and after the stops change.
- **News**: runs in `card-host` during development, but not exercised
  end to end in the shell PRs' test runs (the test phone had no network).
- **Mail**: verified with the demo mailbox on desktop and on the OnePlus 6.
  Mail's and the `llm` host services use the App Hub revision selected by the root
  `Cargo.toml`, shared with the shells, so a build has one `octosense-appstore` and
  one host-service registry.
- **Script bundles have no CI.** [`apps.yml`](../.github/workflows/apps.yml)
  tests the host services, AppCard and the shell services, not the bundles.
- **AppCard `personal-data` skill** reads the old native Mail module's
  `mailbox-*.json` files. The script Mail app's mail now lives in the host
  service's own directory (`<host_dir>/mail/box-*.json`), so the skill
  probably no longer sees it; not verified.
- **Calendar** (2026-10-01, desktop, hidden `--remote` run with a live
  model): the system agent asked Calendar's agent for a card; the first-use
  sheet came up, the agent added an event and its card opened the glance
  panel. Not packed on the phone. Its host service's tests are not in
  `apps.yml` yet.
- Only Camera ships its own launcher icon (`bundle/icon.png`); the shells
  draw the others.

## How the shells pack them

Both shells in this repository ship the system apps: the desktop
([`../desktop`](../desktop/README.md)) and Home ([`../phone`](../phone/README.md),
standalone launcher and ROM image). Each packaging:

1. Lists the apps in its `system-apps.json` (`desktop/system-apps.json`,
   `phone/system-apps.json`), found through `OCTOSENSE_SYSTEM_APPS`: the root
   `.cargo/config.toml` points at the desktop's, `phone/.cargo/config.toml`
   at the phone's (so run phone builds from `phone/`). App Hub's shell crate
   `octosense-app-hub-app` reads that file at build time, packs each
   `apps/<name>/bundle/` into the binary and fills in its digest. `assets`
   maps extra directories into an app's `{{assets}}` (Photos, on the phone):

   ```json
   {
     "schema": 1,
     "source": "../apps",
     "apps": ["news", "photos", "maps", "camera", "mail", "ai-providers"],
     "assets": { "photos": { "photos": "../apps/photos/resources/photos" } }
   }
   ```

2. Links the host services `octosense-mail-service`,
   `octosense-calendar-service`, `octosense-news-service` and
   `octosense-llm-service` (workspace path dependencies) through the shell,
   [`crates/shell`](../crates/shell) (its `app-hub` feature), and registers them at startup (`crates/shell/src/apps.rs`, `register_host_services`): Mail with `register()` for real accounts, or `register_demo()`
   when the shell's app config has `mail_demo: true`. Mail and News install
   `on_notify` callbacks to the shell's common notice renderer; Calendar
   installs its card publisher. The shell registers `NoticeService` for
   remaining system-app namespaces; `llm` with the octos
   kernel's core dir and the shell's QR scanner and image picker (see
   [the `llm` service](#the-llm-service)). App Hub is pinned once, in the root
   `Cargo.toml`, so there is one host-service registry.
3. Starts the shell's AI services through one entry point,
   [`crates/ai-host`](../crates/ai-host/README.md) (`octosense-ai-host`): it
   links `octosense-kernel` from `../crates/kernel` (feature `octos-core` in
   both shells, on by default), configures the kernel at startup and
   registers the `llm` service (with its `octos-core` feature) on the
   kernel's core dir, so a provider change restarts the kernel. See
   [The octos kernel](#the-octos-kernel).
4. Optionally (opt-in `app-appcard`) links AppCard's `octos-app` with
   `default-features = false` and mounts it through its `AppShell` widget
   (see [AppCard](#the-appcard-assistant)); it connects to the same kernel.

There are no pins to move: a change here reaches both shells in the same pull
request.

## A system app bundle

```
apps/<name>/bundle/
  manifest.json     id, version, name, capabilities, network.hosts, integrity
  main.splash       the program
  icon.png|svg      optional launcher art (Camera has one)
  thumbs/ ...       any other files the app loads, as {{assets}}/<path>
```

`main.splash` refers to its own files through the `{{assets}}` placeholder,
which the runner replaces with the origin it serves the bundle from (Photos:
`let assets = "{{assets}}"`, then `assets + "/thumbs/" + id + ".jpg"`).

A system app has the same shape as a store app, with these differences:

| | System app (this repo) | Store app (App Hub) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Id | `os.<name>`. `os.` is reserved: `hub check` refuses it and no device installs one from a store | any other id |
| Delivery | packed into the shell binary at build time from `system-apps.json` | downloaded from the signed catalog |
| Admission | by digest only (`HostLimits::system()`); the source manifest leaves `integrity.bundle_blake3` empty and the build fills it | digest plus publisher signature |
| Ceilings | `HostLimits::system()`: 64 MB storage, 128 MB memory, a larger instruction budget, since the app lives as long as it is open | `HostLimits::default()`: sized for a card |
| Extra files | a shell can mount directories into `{{assets}}` | only what is in the bundle |

Everything else is identical: the same isolate, the same capability checks,
the same network allowlist. How to write such an app (language, APIs, the
`octo` CLI) is in
[OctoScript-App-Design-Flow](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoScript-App-Design-Flow)
(`docs/QUICKSTART.md`, `docs/SCRIPT-API.md`).

## Running a bundle during development

App Hub's `card-host` runs one bundle under the policy its manifest resolves
to, with the same admission order a device uses. The `--system` and `--static`
flags, and host-service support, are on App Hub `main` (since
[OctoSense-App-Hub#4](https://github.com/OctoSense-org/OctoSense-App-Hub/pull/4)).

```sh
# in an OctoSense-App-Hub checkout; <OctoSense> is a checkout of this repository
cargo build --release -p octosense-card-host --bin card-host

card-host --bundle <OctoSense>/apps/news/bundle --system
card-host --bundle <OctoSense>/apps/photos/bundle --system --static photos=<dir of full-size photos>
```

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--bundle <dir>` | the bundle (default: current directory) |
| `--system` | admit as a system app: digest only, system ceilings; an empty digest is filled in memory |
| `--static <prefix>=<dir>` | serve `<dir>` at `{{assets}}/<prefix>/...`, as a shell serves a mounted directory |
| `--app-data <dir>` | where the app's storage jail is made (default `$TMPDIR/octosense-card-apps`) |
| `--allow-unsigned`, `--stamp` | for store bundles; not needed with `--system` |

The log line `card-host: <id> <version> admitted — capabilities …, hosts …`
shows what the app got; `card-host: refused: …` means nothing is drawn.

Set `MAKEPAD_REMOTE=<port>` to drive the window over localhost HTTP
(`/snap`, `/click?x=..&y=..`, `/g` for a screenshot, `/quit`); App Hub's
`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` lists the routes.

**Mail** needs its host service, and `card-host` registers none. Run Mail in
a shell build that links the service, with the demo mailbox (any address,
password `demo`, sample messages, sends that go nowhere):

```sh
# the desktop, from the repository root
MAKEPAD_APP_CONFIG='{"mail_demo":true}' cargo run --release -p octosense
# Home in a phone-sized window, from phone/
MAKEPAD_APP_CONFIG='{"mail_demo":true}' cargo run --release -p octosense-home --features mobile-only
```

The demo keeps its password in a file, so no keychain prompt appears.

## Host services and sheets

Some work needs something a contained app must never hold: a socket, a
credential, a device. A **host service** does that work in the shell, in
Rust. The app calls it with `host.request("<family>.<method>", args, fn(r){…})`;
the isolate refuses the call unless the manifest grants the family (`mail`),
and the service answers with data, never the means. The runtime side lives in
App Hub (`crates/appstore/src/services.rs`).

When the person has to act (type a password, approve an account), the service
raises a **sheet**: a host-owned Splash surface drawn over the app, in its own
isolate under no app's policy. Calls from the sheet arrive marked
`from_sheet`.

**Secrets are the host's.** No app collects a password, PIN or one-time code:

- a password field in a contained app takes no input;
- methods that carry a secret live under `<family>.sheet.*`
  (`mail.sheet.submit`, `mail.sheet.cancel`) and are dispatched only when
  they come from the sheet, before any service sees them;
- only a service can open a sheet; an app cannot.

### The `mail` service

`octosense-mail-service` (`apps/mail/host-service/src/`):

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `lib.rs` | the service: `mail.accounts`, `add_account` (raises the sign-in sheet), `remove_account`, `folders`, `sync`, `list`, `message`, `mark_read`, `send`, `notify` (the agent's notice: handed to the shell, which publishes its notice card as Mail, `on_notify`); `register()`, `register_demo()`, `register_with*()`; the `Transport` trait; account events for the shell (`on_account_event`) |
| `imap.rs` | IMAP client (folders, read flag back to the server) |
| `network.rs` | POP3 and SMTP, MIME decoding; credentials never appear in errors |
| `html.rs` | rebuilds a message as the few tags Mail's `Html` view draws, with nothing remote in it |
| `vault.rs` | where passwords go: macOS/iOS Keychain, Android (a file sealed with an Android Keystore key), owner-only file elsewhere, the files in the host's secrets folder `<home>/secrets/os.mail/`; `OCTOSENSE_MAIL_VAULT=file` forces the file store for unsigned dev builds |
| `contacts.rs` | the addresses the person's accounts sent mail to, for the approval rule "recipients in my contacts" (off until the person turns it on in Settings) |

Account metadata (no passwords) and fetched mail live under the host's own
directory (`<host_dir>/mail`), outside every app's jail. Each account is
granted only to the apps that added it. The service tests an account before
keeping it.

### The `calendar` service

`octosense-calendar-service` (`apps/calendar/host-service/src/lib.rs`) answers
only Calendar (`os.calendar`): App Hub's capability list has no `calendar`,
so no other app can be granted it, and the shell runs Calendar's agent's
`calendar.*` tools on it as the system app's own service.

| Method | Args | Answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `calendar.events` | `{from?, to?, limit?}` | `{events: [{id, title, start, end, location, notes}]}`, soonest first |
| `calendar.add_event` | `{title, start, end?, location?, notes?}` | `{id, start}` |
| `calendar.remove_event` | `{id}` | `{removed}` |
| `calendar.notify` | `{event}` or `{title, when, location?, notes?}`, and `{card_id?, priority?}` | `{card_id, replaced, expires_at}` once an event card (`resources/event.card`) is on the glance screen, with a notification |
| `calendar.agenda` | `{days?}` | the same, for the agenda card (`resources/agenda.card`): the next three events within `days` (7) |

Times are local (`2026-10-02T15:00`, or a date for the whole day). Events
live in `<host_dir>/calendar/events.json`, outside every app's jail.

### The `llm` service

`octosense-llm-service` (`apps/ai-providers/host-service`) is the Rust half
of AI providers. It keeps the octos kernel's LLM providers in the kernel's
profile, `<core_dir>/profiles/_main.json` (`octosense-llm-config` merges
`config.llm` and `config.env_vars`, keeping every other key), and the keys
where octos reads them: the macOS keychain `octos` service behind a
`keychain:` marker, `<core_dir>/secrets/` on Linux, the app-private profile
itself elsewhere (Android). Keys are typed, QRs shown and codes scanned only
on the host's sheets; the app sees masked status. Built with its `octos-core`
feature (the shells' default), it writes under
`octosense_kernel::core_dir()` and calls `octosense_kernel::restart()`
after every change, so the running kernel picks up the new providers. The
method table and registration are in its
[README](ai-providers/host-service/README.md).

**Talk to Octos** (off by default): **AI providers → Talk to Octos** turns on a loopback server so a web client or a terminal UI can talk to this device's assistant. While it is on, the kernel runs as `octos serve --host-managed` instead of `--stdio` and native apps keep working over its WebSocket; external clients get a separate token that opens the UI Protocol socket and nothing else. A web client pairs with a one-time code or the QR of its link; a terminal client of this user reads the private connection file. The server stays up when native apps close, until it is turned off or the shell exits. See [ADR 0003](../docs/adr/0003-shared-octos-client-access.md) and the [kernel guide](../crates/kernel/README.md).

## App agents

An app agent is the app's own octos peer, owned by the system agent: its own
workspace (the app's account folder, `apps/<id>/accounts/<account>/`), memory,
model lane and tools. Which system apps have one, and how
([`../crates/shell/src/apps.rs`](../crates/shell/src/apps.rs) `agent_apps`,
[`../crates/shell/src/host_tools/script_apps.rs`](../crates/shell/src/host_tools/script_apps.rs)):

| App | `manifest.json` | `tools.json` | Cards |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| News | `agent` block, `glance` | `news.list`, `news.read` (read, shareable), `news.notify` (act, background) | the shell's notice card |
| Mail | `agent` block, `glance`, `storage.accounts` (the agent acts for the signed-in account) | `mail.notify` (act, background) | the shell's notice card |
| Calendar | `agent` block, `glance` | `calendar.events` (read), `calendar.add_event` (act), `calendar.remove_event` (destructive, `confirm: host`), `calendar.notify`, `calendar.agenda` (act) | `event.card`, `agenda.card` |
| Photos, Maps, YouTube, Camera | `agent` block, `glance` | `photos.notify`, `maps.notify`, `youtube.notify`, `camera.notify` (act, background) | the shell's notice card |

**A service API is not automatically an agent tool.** Mail currently exposes
only `mail.notify` in its agent tool file; its UI's `mail.list`, `mail.message`
and `mail.send` methods are not thereby available to its agent. The peer's
workspace also does not mount Mail's host database or credential vault. Calendar
is a working example of an agent reading/writing its app data through declared
Rust tools; its script window currently only explains how to ask the agent.
See the [data-access walkthrough](../desktop/docs/code-walkthrough.md#4-follow-a-tool-into-app-data-and-glance).

- **Declaring one.** The manifest's `agent` block names the kernel tools the
  agent may use (`"tools": ["ask_user_question"]`; a dotted name there asks
  for another app's shareable tool), and `bundle/tools.json` declares the
  app's own tools: `<app>.<tool>`, `input_schema`, `output_schema`, `risk`
  (`read`, `act`, `destructive`), `background`, `confirm` (`host` or
  `app`), `shareable` and `implemented_by: "host-service"`. App Hub admits
  and pins both. The `agent` block's `profile` and `model` are admitted but
  not used by the shell yet.
- **Running one.** Nothing runs before the person allows the agent on the
  first-use sheet (shown when the person opens the shell's "Ask <app>"
  panel, with the bar's "Ask <app>", Shift+F8 or the menu row "Ask this
  app's agent", or when the system agent asks it with `agents.ask`). Then
  the shell prepares the peer, so the system agent can reach it with
  `peer_send_input`. `agents.ask` waits for the person's answer and the
  peer (it is declared `outward` with `confirm: app`, so the kernel holds
  it as long as an approval, not a read tool's 30 s), then gives the system
  agent the peer's slug, so the request goes on in the same turn. A turn
  starts only when the system agent, the person
  or a card's in-card chat asks: there are no triggers or schedules yet
  (ADR 0002 M3, planned).
- **Talking to it yourself.** The person can chat with the app's agent
  directly, not only through the system agent: in the "Ask <app>" panel,
  which the shell draws for every app with an agent (none of these apps
  draws a chat of its own). Those turns run in the person's lane, beside
  the system agent's, with the app's tools. For the separate `sys.chat`
  feature, see [in-card chat availability](../README.md#in-card-chat).
  The panel's Stop stops only the person's own turn. On the phone no touch
  control opens the panel yet. See the root
  [README](../README.md#talking-to-an-apps-agent-yourself).
- **Its tools run on the app's host service**, as the app, after the
  shell's relay checked the grant, the schema and the budget. destructive and outward calls (here `calendar.remove_event`) enter the
  approval router. It applies the person's standing rules, host or registered
  app confirmation sheets, and user-enabled developer mode; decisions are
  audited. See [Approvals](../docs/architecture.md#5-approvals).
- **Cards.** `<app>.notify {title, body, card_id?, priority?}` puts a
  notice on the glance screen, with a notification: one fixed L0 card for
  every app, which the shell ships
  ([`../crates/shell/resources/glance/notice.card`](../crates/shell/resources/glance/notice.card),
  filled by [`../crates/shell/src/glance_notice.rs`](../crates/shell/src/glance_notice.rs)),
  with the app's icon and name, the time, and the agent's title (at most 80
  characters) and text (at most 600); the same `card_id` replaces the app's
  earlier notice. Mail's and News's services hand `notify` to the shell;
  Photos, Maps, YouTube and Camera have no service of their own, so the
  shell's notice service answers it. `calendar.notify` and
  `calendar.agenda` fill Calendar's own event and agenda cards. Every card
  is published with `notify` through the shell's `glance` service as the
  app (the app needs the `glance` capability). The model only supplies the
  text; it never writes card code.
- **Trying it** on the desktop: open the assistant (F8) and ask the system
  agent to have an app's agent (Mail, Calendar, News, Photos, Maps or
  YouTube) put a card on the glance screen;
  allow the agent on the sheet that comes up. Mail needs a signed-in
  account (the demo mailbox, below, will do). Mail's richer action card
  ([the plan](mail/docs/2026-10-01-email-action-card-plan.md)) is so far a
  demo with fake data: `OCTOSENSE_GLANCE_DEMO=mail` publishes it at
  startup. **Unverified recipe.**

## The octos kernel

The octos agent kernel is a **shell service**, not part of any app.
[`crates/kernel`](../crates/kernel) (`octosense-kernel`) is that
service; the shells link it by default (cargo feature `octos-core`, also on
in `mobile-apps` and native mobile builds):

- **One per process, on demand.** The first consumer's `connect()` starts it:
  `octos serve --stdio` as a child on desktop and Android (on Android the
  APK's bundled `liboctos.so`), the canonical core in-process on
  OpenHarmony. Later consumers share it; each gets only the replies to its
  own requests and its own sessions' notifications. It stops when the last
  consumer leaves.
- **Configured by AI providers.** The `llm` host service writes the kernel's
  profile, `<core_dir>/profiles/_main.json`, and keys (macOS keychain `octos`
  service behind `keychain:` markers, `<core_dir>/secrets/` on Linux, the
  profile itself elsewhere), then calls `restart()`: a running kernel stops,
  its consumers reconnect and a fresh kernel reads the new providers.
- **Consumers.** AppCard (opt-in) connects through its transport's `kernel`
  module; Rinx's native mini-app host can take its own connection the same
  way instead of sharing AppCard's.
- **The core dir.** The shell's choice, else `$OCTOS_APP_CORE_DIR`, else on a
  phone `<app data dir>/octos-home/.octos`, else `$HOME/octos-home/.octos`.
  On a desktop a kernel runs only when a binary is configured (the shell's,
  or `$OCTOS_APP_CORE_BIN`); without one the providers are still saved.

Tests, from the repository root: `cargo test --locked -p octosense-kernel`;
with a built `octos`,
`OCTOS_CORE_TEST_KERNEL=<octos> cargo test --locked -p octosense-kernel --test real_kernel` starts a real
kernel on a profile written by `octosense-llm-config` and restarts it after a
provider change. Details in [crates/kernel/README.md](../crates/kernel/README.md).

## The AppCard assistant

The "Ask anything" tile. You type a request; a routing brain (the AMA) picks
or composes an app agent; the agent generates a live card, Splash or
webview, that binds real data at render time. It talks to octos over the
octos UI Protocol v1.

- **Code**: `apps/appcard/app`, crates in the root workspace: `octos-app` (router,
  composer, multi-agent dispatch, Splash renderer and validator, L0 card
  generation, WebView overlay), `octos-app-store` (state reducer, no
  Makepad), `octos-app-transport` (the octos UI Protocol over the shell's
  kernel, a WebSocket or REST) and `octos-app-render` (streaming-markdown
  renderer).
- **octos**: every octos crate comes from git `octos-org/octos` at the one
  rev in the root `Cargo.toml` `[workspace.dependencies]` (see that file for the selected revision), shared with `crates/kernel` and the shells. AppCard starts no kernel of its
  own: it connects to the shell's ([The octos kernel](#the-octos-kernel)).
- **Makepad**: not vendored. Makepad, Octoscript and Octoscript-Makepad are
  the checkouts in `.sources/` at the repository root that `tools/setup.py`
  prepares, at the release `native-runtime.lock.json` selects; the root
  `.cargo/config.toml` sets `OCTOSENSE_WORKSPACE=.sources`, so AppCard's
  build embeds its framework assets from there.

Build and test from the repository root (details in [appcard/README.md](appcard/README.md)):

```sh
python3 tools/setup.py                               # prepare .sources/
(cd apps/appcard && PYTHONPATH=tools python3 -m unittest core.test_native_runtime)
cargo clippy --locked -p octos-app -p octos-app-store -p octos-app-transport -p octos-app-render --all-targets --no-deps -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked -p octos-app-transport -p octos-app-store
cargo run -p octos-app                               # standalone window (default feature `standalone`)
```

The standalone app reaches octos through `~/.config/octos-app/server.json`,
or `OCTOS_BASE_URL`/`OCTOS_BEARER`/`OCTOS_PROFILE_ID`, or a local core
binary via `OCTOS_APP_CORE_BIN` and `OCTOS_APP_CORE_DIR`
(`tools/octos-macos.py` sets these up; see `tools/OCTOS-MACOS.md`). Android
and OpenHarmony builds: `docs/BUILDING-ANDROID.md`,
`docs/BUILDING-OPENHARMONY.md`.

**How shells embed it.** A shell depends on `octos-app` with
`default-features = false` (no `fn main`), calls
`octos_app::register_script_mods(vm)`, and mounts `AppShell::create(vm)`: a
widget that owns the app and draws `OctosAppBody`, the app's root without
the standalone `Window`. `AppShell::ask` submits text as if typed. In both
shells this sits in an `AppCardModule` that implements the shell's
`AppModule` trait ([`appcard/module`](appcard/module), package
`octosense-appcard`).

**CI**: [.github/workflows/apps.yml](../.github/workflows/apps.yml) runs on
changes under `apps/`, `crates/`, the workspace files and `tools/setup.py`.
Its macOS job prepares `.sources/`, runs the Mail and `llm` host-service
tests, the AppCard runtime-lock tests, clippy for AppCard's four crates
(which compiles the whole app), AppCard's transport and store tests, and
checks the graph has one octos, one Makepad, one App Hub and one Rinx
source. Its Ubuntu job tests `crates/kernel`, `crates/app-peers` and
`octosense-llm-config`. `apps/appcard/app/.github/workflows/` is left over
from the original repository and does not run.

## Changing an app

1. Edit `apps/<name>/bundle/`. Use only APIs documented in
   OctoScript-App-Design-Flow's `docs/SCRIPT-API.md` or already used by
   another app here; check the runtime source before using anything else.
2. Ask only for what the app uses. A new network host goes in
   `network.hosts`; a new capability must exist in App Hub's
   `KNOWN_CAPABILITIES`.
3. Never add a password or code field. If the app needs a secret, a host
   service and its sheet handle it.
4. Run it with `card-host --system` (Mail: in a shell with the demo). Test on
   a phone through Home built as a separate test package, never by
   replacing the device's installed Home.
5. Open one pull request. The shells pack `apps/` directly, so there is no
   pin to bump.

A **new** system app is a new `apps/<name>/bundle/` with an `os.<name>` id,
plus an entry in each shell's `system-apps.json`.

## Testing

| What | How |
| --- | --- |
| Mail service | `cargo test --locked -p octosense-mail-service` from the repository root. The keychain test is ignored by default: `cargo test -p octosense-mail-service -- --ignored keychain` |
| Calendar and News services | `cargo test --locked -p octosense-calendar-service -p octosense-news-service` (Calendar's are not in `apps.yml` yet) |
| A card's in-card chat | `cargo test --locked -p octosense-l0-chat` |
| octos kernel service | `cargo test --locked -p octosense-kernel` (a stand-in kernel); `OCTOS_CORE_TEST_KERNEL=<octos> cargo test -p octosense-kernel --test real_kernel` (a real one) |
| `llm` service and config | `cargo test --locked -p octosense-llm-service -p octosense-llm-config`; add `--features octosense-llm-service/octos-core` for the shells' build |
| AppCard | the commands above |
| CI | all of the above except the real-kernel and keychain tests: [apps.yml](../.github/workflows/apps.yml) |
| Script bundles | by hand in `card-host` and in a shell, driven over `MAKEPAD_REMOTE`. No automated UI tests here yet |

written in OctoSense-mobile (archived) and OctoScript-App-Design-Flow (formerly Octoscript-AppCard),
where their history remains. AppCard came from
OctoSense-org/OctoSense-AppCard (`d0a836b8`), split from
OctoScript-App-Design-Flow's `app/` at `cbbda4da`.
